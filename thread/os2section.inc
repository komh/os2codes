        ; FLAT property is not necessary unlike NASM manual. FLAT seems
        ; not to have any effect. It has no differences of segment ordering
        ; whether or not using it.
        ; In case of Watcom Linker such as wl.exe, defining CGROUP is important
        ; because kLIBC uses CGROUP for CODE segments. If a CODE segment is not
        ; in CGROUP, then it's not possible to access it with a single segment
        ; register.
        ; In addition, this violates segment ordering of kLIBC.
        ; kLIBC expects ________TEXT segment to be at the end of all the code
        ; segments. However, a CODE segment not in CGROUP is placed after
        ; ________TEXT segment. This may lead to unexpected problems.
        ; If using both FLAT property and GROUP directive, then NASM complains
        ; about multiple-grouping of the same segment although it has no
        ; problems.
        ; After all, omitting FLAT property and using GROUP directive is
        ; better. Or simply use TEXT32 as a CODE segment name, because kLIBC
        ; uses TEXT32 as a CODE segment name.
        ; IBM linkers such as ilink.exe and link386.exe have no CGROUP-related
        ; problems.
        ; In case of VisualAge C++ and Watcom, CGROUP is not defined. Because
        ; of this, rather, defining CGROUP causes a problem. So CGROUP should
        ; not be defined.
        ; And it's not important whether or not using FLAT property.
        ; In any case, FLAT property is not necessary. Just omit it.
